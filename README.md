This projcet uses Java's features of concurrency to run a simple restaurant that makes 4 types of food. 
The simulation has five parameters: the number of customers wishing to enter; 
the number of tables in the restaurant; the number of cooks in the kitchen that fill 
orders; the count of each type of machine in the kitchen used for producing food; and a flag as 
to whether customersâ€™ orders will be randomized.
